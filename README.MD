# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction
As part of GA's WDI program I created a simplistic version of the classic game of tic tac toe with two modes: (1) 2-Player Game or (2) Play the Computer.

I programmed the game to alert the users whenever a winner has thriumphed or when there's a tie. In addition, there's a timer component that allows 3 seconds for any one user to make a move, otherwise the opponent wins.

## Setup
The game requires an html index file, a css styling file, a js file, as well as supplementary jquery files (standard and UI).

## Part 1 - 2-Player Game
```javascript
snakewater_montana = {
  paleontologist: "Dr. Alan Grant",
  depth: "10 meters",
  specimen: "Velociraptor"
}
```
  2. Create a variable called guestOfHonor and assign it's value to the name of the paleontologist at Snakewater, Montana.

  1. Access the value of the specimen found in Snakewater, Montana, and store it in a variable called clever_girl.

## Part 2 - Computer vs Human Game
```javascript
  nicaragua = {
    depth: "200 meters",
    annual_budget: 1500000,
    specimens: [
      "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
      "Stegosaurous",
      "Triceratops",
      "Velociraptor"
    ]
  }
```
  1. Store the array of specimens of this site into a variable called nicaraguanSpecimens.
  2. Make a variable called favoriteSpecimen and assign it's value to your favorite dinosaur within nicaraguanSpecimens ( can you do this by referencing the nicaragua object itself? )
  3. Add 250000 to the annual budget of this site.

## Part 3
```javascript
hammonds_mines = {
  buenos_aires: {
    depth: "400 meters",
    annual_budget: 1000000,
    specimens: [
      "Dilophosaurus",
      "Brachiosaurus"
    ]
  },
  mexico: {
    depth: "350 meters",
    annual_budget: 900000,
    specimens: [
      "Gallimimus",
      "Parasaurolophus"
    ]
  }
}
```
